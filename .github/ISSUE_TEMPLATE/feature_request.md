<!-- Optional
**Use Cases**

The use case describes a series of user and system interactions that helps users accomplish something they wanted to accomplish.

This is useful in case of UI/UX features requests.

The use case technique prescribes a simple step-by-step procedure for how the actor accomplishes the use case. For example, a use case for Step and Repeat might start out as follows: 

- Step 1: The welder presses the step and repeat button to initiate the sequence.
- Step 2: The welding system releases power to the drive motors so that the robot’s arms can be moved manually. 
- Step 3: The welder grabs the trigger, moves the arm to the weldment, and holds down the “weld here” button for each path to be welded.
